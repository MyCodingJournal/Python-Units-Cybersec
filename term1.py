# This program output canada day on the screen

Australia_day = input ("When is Australia day? ")
print ("Australia day is on", Australia_day)

print ("The oldest person alive is Emma Morano, and she is",age)

#or

print ("The oldest person alive is Emma Morano, and she is \t 116")
print ("The oldest person alive is Emma Morano, and she is 116 ")


# This program adds 3 numbers

print ("Please enter 3 numbers. ")
numb1 = int (input("Enter first numner: "))
numb2 = int (input("Enter second number: "))
numb3 = int (input("Enter third number: "))

###Handling different data types in python###

a = 1
b = 2
sum = a + b
print ("The sum total of a + b is", a + b)
print ("The sum total of a + b is", sum)

# print ("The sum total of a + b is" + a + b )
# print ("The sum total of a + b is" + sum)
# This will not work because you can only concatenate string not integer, Plus '+' tells it to concantenate.
# + operator is a concatenation & math operator.

yourNumber = int(input("Enter your number of choice...."))
# coverting input into an integer.
print ("I will add 100 to your number and print....")
newNumber = yourNumber + 100
print ("The new number after adding your number is",str (newNumber)) 
# 'str()' to turn integer into a string

# another example

YourNumber = input("Enter any number of your choice....")
print ("I'll concatenate 100 to your number and will print....")
newNumber = YourNumber + "100" # making the 100 into a string by  using " "
print ("The new number after adding 100 to your number is " + newNumber
) 

# than concatenation '+' is possible here.

# In conclusion you can only add or concatenate data source of the same type.

# Result = A + C (TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str')

A = 2
B = 3
C = "Boxhill"
Result = A + B
print ("The result is", Result)
print ("The result is " + str (Result))
print (f"My results at {C} is", Result) 

# String function from LPTHW! just to test knowledge. Yay!

###Conditional Statements or conditionals###

l = 10
b = 5
AreaOfRectangle =  l * b
print (f"The are of rectangle is {AreaOfRectangle}")
print ("The are of rectangle is " + str(AreaOfRectangle))
print ("The are of rectangle is", str(AreaOfRectangle))
print ("The area of rectangle is", l * 5 )

# are of rectangle

L = int(input("Enter the length of rectangle..."))
B = int(input("Enter the breath of rectangle..."))
AreaOfRectangle = L * B
print ("The are of rectangle is ", L * B)

# area of circle

Pi = 3.14
R = int(input("Enter the radius of circle..."))
AreaOfRectangle = Pi * R * 2
print ("The total area of circle is", Pi * R * 2)

# Conditional statements and conditionals (if, elif, else)
# The script compares 2 numbers input bu user

# Input statments
FirstNumber = int(input("Enter first number..."))
SecondNumber = int(input("Enter second number..."))
# conditional statements
if (FirstNumber>SecondNumber): # first condition
  print ("The first number you entered is greater than the second.") 
  # This block of code will run if expression inside if() returns True.
elif (FirstNumber<SecondNumber): # second condition
  print ("The second number you entered is greater than the first.")
  # This block of code will run if expression inside elif() returns Truie.
else: # no need of expression-covers all cases accept if() and elif()
  print ("The two numbers you entered are equal.")
  # This block of code will run if both expressions inside if() and elif() returns false.

# trying out a simple yes no condition!
# the code didnt run previously because i need to define yes with ""

rain = input("Is it raining now?, answer yes or no: ")
if (rain == "yes"):
  print ("Go home!")
else:
  print ("Yay! let's go out!")

# This script calculates fee payment for extra weight/baggauge.

weight = float(input("How many pounds does your suitcase weigh? "))
if (weight > 50):
  print ("There is a $25 charge for heavy luggage...")
else:
  print ("You are good to go.")
print ("Thank you for your business!")

# This script tells the user if input is negative or positive.

Number = int(input("Enter your number..."))
if (Number > 0):# first condition
  print ("This is a positive number.")
  print ("That means this is greater than 0.")
  # This block will run if the expression inside if() returns True.
elif (Number == 0):# second condition
  print ("You typed zero.")
  # This block will run if the expression inside elif() returns True.
else:# no need for expression, covers all accept if() and elif()
  print ("This is a negative number.")
  print ("That means it is less than 0.")
  # This block will run if both expressions inside if() and elif() returns false.

# Advanced Conditionals Nested If statement.
# i.e if statement inside another if statement.
